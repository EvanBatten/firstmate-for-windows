# Windows measurement (Phase A)

Measured 2026-08-29 on Windows 11 26200 against upstream `f66be0f` (2026-08-28).
Toolchain: Git Bash 5.2.37 (MINGW64), herdr 0.8.2 stable (protocol 20), treehouse 2.3.0, no-mistakes 1.57.0, Claude Code 2.1.251 (native `claude.exe`), gh 2.89, jq 1.6, node 24, tasks-axi 0.2.5, quota-axi 0.1.33, shellcheck 0.11, actionlint 1.7.12.
Developer Mode ON; user env `MSYS=winsymlinks:nativestrict`.
Same shape as the upstream `windows-herdr-spike.yml` table so the two can be read side by side.
The plan that owns the fix list is [plan.html](plan.html) (findings ledger numbers below match it).

| # | Subsystem | Result | Measured detail | Fix owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Line endings at checkout | **FAIL** without `.gitattributes` | `core.autocrlf=true` (system + global); a plain clone had 151/151 `bin/*.sh` with CRLF (`file` reports "with CRLF line terminators"). With `* text=auto eol=lf` committed and `core.autocrlf=false` in the clone: 0/151, and `bin/fm-harness.sh` runs. | PR-1 (`.gitattributes`, this branch) |
| 2 | Harness ancestry (`ps -o`) | **FAIL** | MSYS `ps` rejects `-o` ("unknown option"); a hook bash reports PPID 1. `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process` walked from `/proc/$$/winpid` recovered the full chain: bash.exe → bash.exe → claude.exe → pwsh.exe → treehouse.exe → pwsh.exe → herdr.exe. | PR-2 (`bin/fm-proc-lib.sh`) |
| 3 | `kill -0` on native PIDs | **FAIL** | `kill -0 <herdr.exe pid>` → "No such process"; `ps -W` lists it. MSYS pids (watcher, daemon) work. | PR-2 |
| 4 | Symlink lock (`ln -s`) | **PASS with env** | Default MSYS `ln -s` deep-copied the target; with `MSYS=winsymlinks:nativestrict` a real link was created and `readlink` resolved it. | dotfiles PR #3 (env var, applied) |
| 5 | herdr socket path shape | **FAIL** | `herdr status --json` reports `C:\Users\ebatt\AppData\Roaming\herdr\herdr.sock`; `fm_backend_herdr_canonical_socket_path` refuses anything not starting with `/`, so the launcher same-session proof refuses every spawn. | PR-3 |
| 6 | Crewmate pane shell | **FAIL** | herdr `default_shell = "pwsh"`; `tab create` has no shell/command flag. In a pwsh pane `exec bash -l` fails (`exec` is not a command) and bare `bash` resolves to WSL's bash. Git Bash must be launched as `& 'C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\bash.exe' --login`. | PR-4 |
| 7 | Native event push (python3 AF_UNIX) | **DEGRADED** | `python3 -c "import socket; hasattr(socket,'AF_UNIX')"` → False on Store Python 3.13.5 and Anaconda 3.12; the reader exits 2 and the watcher polls (designed fallback, same as the upstream spike). | accept; optional PR-5 (.NET reader) |
| 8 | Presentation workspace ordering | **DEGRADED** | `herdr-workspace-move.py` requires a `/`-prefixed socket path and returns 2; adapter warns and continues. | accept |
| 9 | Presentation lock namespace (mode 700) | **FAIL** | Every Git Bash mount is `noacl` (`mount`: `/`, `/tmp`, `/c`). `mkdir -m 700` creates a 755 directory and exits 1; the validity check fails; the adapter then prints "herdr task kill could not acquire its session presentation lock; refusing an unlocked pane close" (3x in the smoke test). Teardown cannot close panes. | PR-3 |
| 10 | Stale git lock proof (`lsof`) | **DEGRADED** | No `lsof`; `fm-lock-lib.sh` fails safe and never removes a lock. | accept |
| 11 | Claude Code hook execution | **PASS** | Throwaway `.claude/settings.json` hook under `claude -p`: ran in `/usr/bin/bash` 5.2 (MINGW64), `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR=C:/Users/...` (forward slashes), `exec "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"/bin/probe.sh` succeeded, `CLAUDECODE=1` present. | none |
| 12 | MSYS argument path conversion | **FAIL** | As received by `herdr.exe`: `/clear` → `C:/Program Files/Git/clear`, `--match=/x` → `--match=X:/`, `/tmp/x` → `C:/Users/ebatt/AppData/Local/Temp/x`. `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` or `MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL=*` stops it. `--cwd /c/Users/x` → `C:/Users/x` is the one conversion that is wanted. | PR-3 |
| 13 | Pane cwd tracking | **FAIL, mechanism found** | `pane get .foreground_cwd` is always `null` on the Windows build (the smoke test's one failure). `pane get .cwd` is live: herdr injects a pwsh prompt hook that emits `ESC]9;9;<path>ESC\` after each prompt. A Git Bash child started with `PROMPT_COMMAND='printf "\033]9;9;%s\033\\" "$(cygpath -w "$PWD")"'` moved `.cwd` through `cd /c/Users/ebatt/dotfiles` and `cd /tmp` exactly. `pane process-info` lists only the pwsh root in `foreground_processes`. | PR-4 |
| 14 | Universal toolchain | **PASS** | After dotfiles PR #3: `FM_BOOTSTRAP_DETECT_ONLY=1 FM_BOOTSTRAP_NETWORK=skip bin/fm-bootstrap.sh` in the live home prints only the herdr auto-detect NOTICE (zero MISSING, no TANGLE with `origin/HEAD` = `windows`). | dotfiles PR #3 |
| 15 | Treehouse lease | **PASS** | Windows treehouse 2.3.0 has `get --lease`, `--lease-holder`, `--json`. | none |
| 16 | herdr protocol floors | **PASS** | 0.8.2, protocol 20, `compatible: true`. | none |
| 17 | coreutils and friends | **PASS** | `mktemp`, `stat -c`, `timeout`, `realpath`, `install`, `column`, `fold`, `tput`, `perl`, `shasum`, `sha256sum`, `openssl`, `base64`, `mkfifo`, `/proc/<pid>/stat` all present. | none |
| 18 | no-mistakes | **PASS** | Native `claude.exe` + `agent_path_override` (dotfiles P4). | none |
| 19 | Install helpers / bootstrap hints | **DEGRADED** | `uname -s` = `MINGW64_NT-10.0-26200`; CI-only installers die "unsupported platform"; bootstrap prints `brew install` hints. | optional |
| 20 | Wedge alarm notifier | **DEGRADED** | No OS notifier on Windows. | dotfiles nicety (Phase C) |
| 21 | POSIX mode privacy checks | **FAIL (cross-cutting)** | 33 of 151 `bin/*.sh` create or assert mode-700/600 private state; every such check misfires on `noacl` mounts (rows 9, the `fm-x-mode` and `fm-test-run` test failures are all instances). A process-local `mount -o binary,posix=0,acl <ntfs dir> /mnt/p` made `mkdir -m 700` succeed with `stat` reporting 700, inherited by a child bash; `chmod 600` on a file returned EINVAL in that process-local mount and needs re-measuring under a real `/etc/fstab` mount (admin). | decision D6: targeted `acl` fstab mounts vs. an upstream shared helper |
| S | Real-herdr smoke test | **14 / 15** | `tests/fm-backend-herdr-smoke.test.sh` against an isolated lab session: version check, container ensure (idempotent), task tab create/prune/refuse/replace, secondmate workspace isolation, restart survival, `send_text_line`, `send_literal` + Enter all pass; `current_path` fails (row 13). 25 s wall. | rows 9, 13 |
| L | Portable test lanes | see below | `bin/fm-test-run.sh --check-coverage` → `ok total=167 parallel=24 serial=131 serial_shards=4 herdr=12`. | Phase B tracks the count |

## Portable lane results

Lanes were run with `--per-script-timeout-secs 300`; results are appended here as they finish.
Each red script is classified as product (a real Windows defect in `bin/`), test (an assumption of the test harness itself), or platform (a documented degradation), before Phase B chases it.

Both lanes ran with `MSYS=winsymlinks:nativestrict` exported (an earlier attempt without it added symlink-copy failures such as `ln: failed to create symbolic link .../fakebin/printf`, which the env var removes).
Wall time is roughly 10x Linux because every process spawn crosses the MSYS/Win32 boundary.

### portable-parallel-2: 6 green / 7 red of 13 (670 s)

| Script | Result | First failing assertion | Class (provisional) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fm-send-popup-settle, fm-tmux-submit-busy, fm-send-settle, fm-send-strict, fm-spawn-batch, fm-supervision-instructions | **PASS** | | |
| fm-backend-herdr | FAIL | "the ambiguity refusal did not name the candidate workspaces (missing: 'w1 w7')", yet the captured stderr names `(w1 w7)` | test (assertion text match; check for `\r` or quoting in the capture) |
| fm-arm-pretool-check | FAIL | "D01 via codex must deny, got exit 0" for `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh &` | product-suspect: the watcher-protection guard fails OPEN on the codex path; top of the Phase B list |
| fm-crew-state | FAIL | "timed-out no-mistakes falls back to pane (missing: 'state: working')" | unknown; timing or `ps`-based liveness (row 2) |
| fm-herdr-lab | FAIL | "timed-out provision must fail: expected exit 1, got 0" | test/timing under slow spawn |
| fm-pr-merge | FAIL | "github-zero-exit-queue-required: refusal did not name the concrete observed state" | unknown (fake `gh` fixture) |
| fm-ensure-agents-md | FAIL | "CRLF AGENTS.md injection did not preserve CRLF line endings" | unknown; the one test that wants CRLF kept, worth a look next to row 1 |
| fm-composer-lib | FAIL | "a half-block rule row must count as a structural edge" | unknown; text-width or locale handling of block glyphs |

### portable-parallel-1: 5 green / 5 red / 1 gate-skip of 11 (903 s)

| Script | Result | First failing assertion | Class (provisional) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fm-composer-ghost, fm-grok-harness, fm-review-diff, fm-brief, fm-transition-lib | **PASS** | (fm-grok-harness passes only with `MSYS=winsymlinks:nativestrict`) | |
| fm-pi-primary-types | gate-skip | pi not installed | |
| fm-x-mode | FAIL | "poll auth error must write a dedupe marker" (next assertion wants `state/` at mode 700) | platform: row 21 |
| fm-cd-pretool-check | FAIL | "transport must fail open when node is unavailable: expected exit 0, got 127" | product-suspect: the cd guard's no-node fallback exits 127 instead of failing open; sibling of the arm-pretool finding |
| fm-captain-hold-lifecycle | TIMEOUT | exceeded the 300 s per-script bound (failed in 11 s without the env var) | unknown; hang once symlinks are real, investigate with `bash -x` |
| fm-test-run | FAIL | "isolation failure: worker root mode is 755, expected 0700" | platform: row 21 (the runner's own `--jobs` isolation check) |
| fm-lint | FAIL | "installer did not fall back to shasum -a 256" | test: exercises `fm-install-shellcheck.sh`, which dies on `uname` (row 19) before the fallback |

### Count to beat

11 green, 12 red, 1 gate-skip across the 24 portable-parallel scripts, plus 14 of 15 in the real-herdr smoke test.
Of the 12 red, 3 are row 21 (POSIX modes), 1 is row 19, 2 are guard fail-open suspects (`fm-arm-pretool-check`, `fm-cd-pretool-check`), 1 is a timeout, and 5 need a first look.
The 131-script portable-serial lane was not run in Phase A (roughly 3 hours at this box's spawn rate); Phase B runs it once the row 21 decision is applied.

## What the spike did not know

- The upstream spike sources `bin/fm-backend.sh` on `windows-latest`; `actions/checkout` there uses Git for Windows defaults, so row 1 applies to CI too until `.gitattributes` lands.
- Row 13's `ESC]9;9;` hook is the whole reason `cwd` works for pwsh on Windows; any shell firstmate launches in a pane must emit it.
- Row 12's conversion also affects `--cwd` in the wanted direction, so a blanket `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` on every herdr call would break pane launch cwds; the fix must be per-argument.
